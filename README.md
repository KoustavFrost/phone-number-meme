# Phone number meme

Okay so few days back I saw a programming meme on a random Facebook page about multiple ways to take phone number inputs from a user.

### Seems fun right? Now lets convert in into code.

> I kinda made this the 1st few commits in a hurry to I didn't had time to actually build the first meme, so I Googled a bit and actually found the exact one shown in the meme on my very first click. Thats come serious coincidence right? BTW I have credited the actual creater inside my code.

### More meme code coming soon ...
